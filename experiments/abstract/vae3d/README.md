# 3D Variational Autoencoders
TODO: something coherent about 3D VAE

## Flavors
Several derivatives VAE experiments are available in the separate yaml files.
- **mse.yaml** is the original experiment with Mean Square Error and [KLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) loss
- **adversarial.yaml** leverages adversarial regularization inspired by [Goodfellow 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

## Compatible Datasets
This experiment can be applied to the following datasets:
- doom
