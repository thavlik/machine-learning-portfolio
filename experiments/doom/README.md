Variational autoencoders (VAE) and other experiments trained on DOOM 1/2 gameplay videos

## Motivation
Latent representations and unsupervised pretraining boost data efficiency on more challenging supervised [1] and reinforcement learning tasks [2]. The goal of this project is to provide both the Doom and machine learning communities with:
- High quality datasets comprised of Doom gameplay
- Various ready-to-run experiments
- Suitable boilerplate for derivative projects

## The Data
Gameplay videos are sourced from Youtube, with permission. Special thanks to the following creators for their contributions to the community and this dataset - these individuals are the lifeblood of the Doom community:
